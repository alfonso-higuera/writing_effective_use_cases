- A use case captures a contract between the _stakeholders_ of a _system_ about its behavior.
	- A use case describes the system's _behavior_ under _various conditions_ as the system responds to a _request_ from one of the stakeholders, called the _primary actor_.
		- The primary actor initiates an interaction with the system to accomplish some _goal_.
		- The system responds protecting the interests of all stakeholders.
		- Different sequences of behavior, or _scenarios_, can unfold, depending on the particular requests made and the conditions surrounding the request.
			- The use case gathers those different scenarios together.
- Under normal circumstances, use cases serve as a means of communication from one person to another.
	- Therefore, it's best to pick a form of expression that does not require special training to be understood.
- A use case can be used in multiple ways.
	- It can be used to stimulate the discussion within a team about an upcoming system.
	- It can be used to document requirements.
	- It can be used to document the final design of a system.
- The size of the system can vary widely.
	- The system can be as large as an entire company.
	- The system can be as small as the module of a software application.
- The amount of rigor and technical detail used to write a use case is variable.
- When a use case is used to document an organization's business process
	- The _system under discussion_ (SuD) is the organization itself.
	- The stakeholders are the company shareholders, customers, vendors, and government regulatory agencies.
	- The primary actors include the company's customers and perhaps their suppliers.
- When a use case records behavioral requirements for a piece of software.
	- The SuD is the computer program.
	- The stakeholders are the users of the computer program, the company owning the program, government regulatory agencies, and other computer systems.
	- The primary actors include the users of the computer program and other computer systems.
